         * The number of max retries is tunable
         * The number of max exceptions, failures is tunable
         * The number of permitted stalls is also tunable
         * Exceptions can be auto-retried, but by default are not.
   * Worker class changes
      * Access signatures change
         * $jobManager made private in Worker base class.  Still accessible through getJobManager()
      * Access to Current Job (inspired by the fork of @wzele)
         * $this->getCurrentJob() will return the current Job object during a worker's method invocation.
            * This may be useful if you want to record some message by calling $this->getCurrentJob()->setMessage('some message');
            * However only Doctrine Jobs are persisted on SUCCESS         
      * $jobClass removed
         * $jobClass member variable, and getJobClass() / setJobClass() functions removed (now loaded from JobManager).
      * $jobManager made private - use getter/setter to access it.

      * All Manager classes and interfaces into their own Manager directory
   * New STATUS_FAILURE
      * If you return \Dtc\QueueBundle\Model\Worker::RESULT_FAILURE from your Worker's function, it will be recorded as
         a failure, not an error
   * BaseJob::STATUS_ERROR => BaseJob::STATUS_EXCEPTION
      * Exceptions are now recorded as such.
      * Exception information is recorded in the end of the message of the 
   * Changed STATUS_ERROR to STATUS_EXCEPTION
   * Refactoring
      * JobManager base class heirarchy has been refactored.
         * Supports retryable jobs in all JobManager types
